*Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree - Term 2, Project 1*

### **Project Overview**

This project contains the results from Project 1 of Term 2 in the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. The goal of this project is to create an Extended Kalman Filter that fuses Lidar and Radar measurements.

For testing, the project uses the Term 2 Simulator, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

To help in installing dependencies, there is a [script](./install-mac.sh). Once the install for dependencies is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF
